## Issue #4: Taming the Cloud Beast: Mastering Manual Linux Server Deploys

**Junior Devs,**

We've explored Docker for streamlined deployments and the power of exceptional documentation. Now, it's time to tackle the final frontier – conquering manual deployments to Linux servers in the cloud!

**Why Manual Cloud Deploys?**

While automated deployments have their place, understanding manual deployments offers several benefits:

* **Deeper Understanding:**  Gaining first-hand experience with the deployment process fosters a deeper understanding of the entire development lifecycle. 
* **Troubleshooting Prowess:**  Learning to manually deploy equips you with valuable troubleshooting skills when dealing with deployment issues. 
* **Increased Confidence:**  Mastering this skill builds confidence and empowers you to handle unexpected deployment scenarios.

**Gearing Up for Cloud Conquest:**

Before we dive in, ensure you have the following:

* **Cloud Provider Account:** Sign up for a free tier account with a major cloud provider like AWS, Azure, or GCP.
* **SSH Client:** Download and install an SSH client like PuTTY for Windows or the built-in terminal for macOS/Linux.
* **Basic Linux Knowledge:** Familiarize yourself with basic Linux commands for navigation and file management.

**The Deployment Dance:**

Here's a simplified breakdown of the manual deployment process:

1. **Prepare Your Application:** Ensure your Java application is packaged correctly for deployment, including any dependencies.
2. **Connect to Your Server:** Use your SSH client to establish a secure connection to your Linux server in the cloud.
3. **Transfer Your Application:** Upload your application files to the appropriate location on the server.
4. **Configure Your Environment:** Set up any necessary environment variables or configurations on the server.
5. **Start Your Application:** Use systemd or another service management tool to launch your application on the server.
6. **Verification and Testing:**  Verify that your application is running correctly and perform thorough testing.

**Resources to Guide Your Journey:**

* **AWS Manual Deployment Guide:** [Sample doc URL - replace with a relevant AWS manual deployment doc] (For other cloud providers, search for similar guides)
* **Linux System Administration Tutorial:** [Sample tutorial URL - replace with a relevant Linux system administration tutorial]

**Remember,** manual deployments require a solid understanding of Linux commands and server administration principles. Don't be afraid to experiment in a safe, non-production environment and leverage online resources to overcome any challenges.

**Conquering these three skills – Docker, Documentation, and Manual Cloud Deploys – will propel you to the next level as a Java developer.**

**In the next issue, we'll open the floor for Q&A.  Fire away with any lingering questions you have!**
