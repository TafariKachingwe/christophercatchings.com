Symptoms

You may be trying to restart MySQL and see the following error:

 

[ERROR] Bad magic header in tc log
[ERROR] Crash recovery failed. Either correct the problem (if it's, for example, out of memory error) and restart, or delete tc log and start mysqld with --tc-heuristic-recover={commit|rollback}
[ERROR] Can't init tc log
[ERROR] Aborting

 

 
Description 

This might mean that the transaction coordinator log is corrupt.

 
Workaround

Remove or rename the tc.log file before restarting MySQL. To complete this, run the following commands as root via SSH or the WHM terminal:

 

mv -vi /var/lib/mysql/tc.log /root
/usr/local/cpanel/scripts/restartsrv_mysql
